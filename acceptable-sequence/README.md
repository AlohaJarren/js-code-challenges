# Acceptable Sequence

## Instructions

1.  In your terminal, run the command `npm install`
2.  Open your text editor and write your code in `acceptableSequence.js`
3.  In your terminal run the command `npm test` to test your code
4.  To exit test press `ctrl+c` in your terminal

## Challenge

You are given a string containing letters and the + and = symbols as an argument. You need to return true if the given string is an acceptable sequence, otherwise return false. In this case, an acceptable sequence should return true if each letter is surrounded by a + symbol.

Example:

```
acceptableSequence('a=+++==b+==c+') // returns false because 'a' is not surrounded by the + symbol on each sides

acceptableSequence('+x+===+y+++z++') // returns true because each letter is surrounded by the + symbol
```
