# Reverse Message

## Instructions

1.  In your terminal, run the command `npm install`
2.  Open your text editor and write your code in `reverseMessage.js`
3.  In your terminal run the command `npm test` to test your code
4.  To exit test press `ctrl+c` in your terminal

## Challenge

You are given a string as an argument. Reverse the string so that the words and letters passed into it are made lower case and reversed. In addition, capitalize the first letter of the newly reversed words. If a number or symbol(!#,>) is now in the first position of the word, no capitalization needs to occur.

Example:

```
reverseMessage('This is an example of a Reversed Message!'); // returns '!egassem Desrever A Fo Elpmaxe Na Si Siht'
```
