## Challenge

Your task is to split a candy bar of given dimensions n x m into small squares. The size of each square is 1x1 and unbreakable. Return the minimum number of splits needed to break the candy bar into single squares.

For example if you are given a 2x1 candy bar you can split it to single squares in just one break, but for size 3x1 you must do two breaks.

Example:

```
minimumSplits(3, 8) // returns 23

minimumSplits(1, 1) // returns 0
```
